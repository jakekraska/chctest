# CHC-CAT

This repository includes the data generated by the [CHC-CAT project](https://github.com/jakekraska/phd).

## About

Data for the PhD was collected throughout 2019. Additional data collection was conducted for this project in 2020 and 2021 that was not included in the [PhD thesis](https://github.com/jakekraska/phd).

This data can be used to calculate paramaters for the CHC-CAT which can be used with people 6 years and older. In order to host the CHC-CAT you will need to be familiar with a computer adaptive testing platform such as mirtCAT or Concerto Platform, and you will need the item stimuli which can be obtained from [Jake Kraska](mailto:jake.kraska@gmail.com). See the original PhD thesis for relevant JavaScript code for the presentation of Working Memory items. 

## Authors and Contributions

Dr Jake Kraska was the project lead for the collection of this data. Supervision for the PhD was provided by Dr Shane Costello, Dr John Roodenburg and Associate Professor Wendy McKenzie.
